# X-SAMPA to IPA

Turn X-SAMPA (no characters outside of ASCII) into IPA (fancy Unicode). Sure, this program has been written plenty of times by other developers/linguists, but I figured I'd have a crack at it. 

Currently support is only extended to phones of in American English.

Call xsampa.py from a command prompt, etc. (I recommend putting it in your PATH), and it will read your X-SAMPA from sys.argv.

# Requirements
tkinter and pyperclip
